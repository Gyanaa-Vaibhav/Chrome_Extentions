# Chrome_Extentions

## Quick Note

First project this is a clone/copy of any notes app saves me a hassle of opening another app as I just can scroll to the top and save my next ground braking idea or just the price of rentals in banglore

## Pomodoro Timer

A timer to code and study more efficiently the gimmick it doesn't work as chrome stops the JavaScript run by extension when they are not in use or not open yeah a **failed** attempt but at least the styling looks good and is dynamic
